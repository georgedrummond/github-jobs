        Meetup API allows members and organizers to write software extensions to their
        local community. Photography Meetups use the API to create photo browsers
        tailored to their needs, large outdoor groups have built their own platform
        to keep their members active, and data scientists consume and analyze public
        Meetup\u2019s public data streams.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the global Meetup
        community\u2019s interaction with our API, over a quarter of members use our
        native apps to find and connect with communities that matter to them. This
        activity flows directly through the API platform, and you will work most closely
        with Meetup\u2019s mobile team to enable richer experiences for members.</p>\n\n<p>The
        Meetup backend is a hybrid JVM stack including Scala, Python, and Java. New

        fast growing mobile game company.  Both of our games -- Disco Bees and Say
        the Same Thing -- have been featured by Apple editors and one was a \u201cBest
        Games of 2013\u201d selection.  Our user base is expanding quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Two
        of our founding partners are developers and they both have diverse backgrounds
        in music, architecture, and math.  By combining a range of skills, we keep
        our team tight and sharp.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for another developer that
        is curious, broadly talented, and extremely smart.  We want someone who can
        take responsibility for complex projects and complete them brilliantly.  We
        want someone with good taste and good decision making ability about products.  We
        want someone that we trust to take on major efforts in the company.</p>\n\n<p>Our
        team is small, super talented, and very focused.  We are funny.  We move fast
        and we want to work with people who can think both broadly and specifically,
        who are very motivated, understand our vision, and will work hard to achieve
        specific goals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why should you choose to work with us?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s
        a few reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We aren\u2019t a big corporation, we don\u2019t
        act like one, and it\u2019s just a more satisfying way to live.  It\u2019s
        also extremely effective.  We are able to compete directly with companies
        that are literally 15 times our size.</p></li>\n<li><p>We work remotely.  Maybe
        you don\u2019t live in NYC or SF or LA but you want to be on a world-class
        team.  You can do that with us.  We have founders in NYC, LA, Providence RI,
        and somewhere in Alabama.  If you live in one of those places, that\u2019s
        even better, we can hang out.</p></li>\n<li><p>We think we\u2019re pretty
        fun to work with.  And we want to make sure your work life is as satisfying
        as possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>We care about good design and great products.  You\u2019ll
        have a chance to work with world-class designers and great product minds.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And
        now to the tech skills:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We just need a great programmer.  If
        you know you are one of the best around, we want to talk.  It\u2019s pretty
        much as simple as that.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our games are primarily built in
        cocos2dx (C++).  If you have experience there, that\u2019s great.  If you
        don\u2019t but you are a great developer, that could be fine-- we just learned
        cocos2dx recently ourselves.</p></li>\n<li><p>We of course work with lots
        of other technologies and related services: Ruby on Rails, postgresql, Objective-C,
        Java/JNI/Android, APNS/GCM, Facebook API/SDK, Game Center, SpriteKit, and
        more.   </p></li>\n<li><p>There\u2019s a big server-side component to our
        games.  If you have great Rails and/or postgres experience or other relevant
        web app experience, let us know.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Does this sound like
