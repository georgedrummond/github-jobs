        fast growing mobile game company.  Both of our games -- Disco Bees and Say
        the Same Thing -- have been featured by Apple editors and one was a \u201cBest
        Games of 2013\u201d selection.  Our user base is expanding quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Two
        of our founding partners are developers and they both have diverse backgrounds
        in music, architecture, and math.  By combining a range of skills, we keep
        our team tight and sharp.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for another developer that
        is curious, broadly talented, and extremely smart.  We want someone who can
        take responsibility for complex projects and complete them brilliantly.  We
        want someone with good taste and good decision making ability about products.  We
        want someone that we trust to take on major efforts in the company.</p>\n\n<p>Our
        team is small, super talented, and very focused.  We are funny.  We move fast
        and we want to work with people who can think both broadly and specifically,
        who are very motivated, understand our vision, and will work hard to achieve
        specific goals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why should you choose to work with us?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s
        a few reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We aren\u2019t a big corporation, we don\u2019t
        act like one, and it\u2019s just a more satisfying way to live.  It\u2019s
        also extremely effective.  We are able to compete directly with companies
        that are literally 15 times our size.</p></li>\n<li><p>We work remotely.  Maybe
        you don\u2019t live in NYC or SF or LA but you want to be on a world-class
        team.  You can do that with us.  We have founders in NYC, LA, Providence RI,
        and somewhere in Alabama.  If you live in one of those places, that\u2019s
        even better, we can hang out.</p></li>\n<li><p>We think we\u2019re pretty
        fun to work with.  And we want to make sure your work life is as satisfying
        as possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>We care about good design and great products.  You\u2019ll
        have a chance to work with world-class designers and great product minds.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And
        now to the tech skills:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We just need a great programmer.  If
        you know you are one of the best around, we want to talk.  It\u2019s pretty
        much as simple as that.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our games are primarily built in
        cocos2dx (C++).  If you have experience there, that\u2019s great.  If you
        don\u2019t but you are a great developer, that could be fine-- we just learned
        cocos2dx recently ourselves.</p></li>\n<li><p>We of course work with lots
        of other technologies and related services: Ruby on Rails, postgresql, Objective-C,
        Java/JNI/Android, APNS/GCM, Facebook API/SDK, Game Center, SpriteKit, and
        more.   </p></li>\n<li><p>There\u2019s a big server-side component to our
        games.  If you have great Rails and/or postgres experience or other relevant
        web app experience, let us know.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Does this sound like

        Success team are primarily responsible for onboarding our customers. We start
        work the moment a customer decides they want to use Intercom, and we stick
        with them every step of the way to ensure they get the most value from the
        product. </p>\n\n<p>Engineers on the success team are responsible for working
        with customers to solve technical problems, help with their integrations,
        and diagnose, report, and solve problems with our software. </p>\n\n<p>This
        position suits junior engineers who wish to gain experience with world class
        software teams and become full time product engineers. Ideally you would achieve
        a promotion to product engineer after a year. </p>\n\n<h3>About the company</h3>\n\n<p>Intercom
        (<a href=\"http://www.intercom.io\">www.intercom.io</a>) is a simple, personal
        messaging service for businesses and their customers. It provides a single,
        integrated platform for the whole company to use for support, marketing, product,
        sales communication and more.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re on a mission to make web
        and mobile business personal. We believe that the future of customer communication
        requires not increasingly complex, impersonal point solutions, but rather
        a simple, seamless platform that applies innovations found in consumer services
        like Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in late 2011, Intercom has raised
        over $30 million in venture capital and is backed by leading investors, The
        Social+Capital Partnership and Bessemer Venture Partners. Intercom has been
        adopted by thousands of businesses, including Heroku, Hootsuite, Rackspace,
        Yahoo! and Perfect Audience. Our customers love the product: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intercom/favorites\">https://twitter.com/intercom/favorites</a></p>\n\n<p>We

        forever how Internet businesses and their customers communicate.</p>\n\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>To
        perform well on the Customer Success team, there are 3 requirements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Technical
        knowledge. This is a technically challenging position and is ideal for candidates
        looking to grow their skillset as an engineer. You&#39;ll be faced with debugging
        complex issues not only within our own codebase but also with lots of other
        technologies employed by our users. You&#39;ll be working with and learning
        a myriad of tech, including but not limited to: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB,
        MySQL, Redis, Pusher, nginx, Sinatra, Sidekiq, and lots more. Good problem
        solving skills are necessary. If you do not have direct experience with the
        above but can demonstrate that you&#39;re a quick learner with an appeitite
        for personal development, do still contact us. </li>\n<li>Great communicator.
        You will be talking with lots of our customers on a daily basis. The customer
        success team is responsible for ensuring that newly acquired customers have
        a great experience with the product. You need to be a very competent writer
        with the ability to explain complex topics in easy to understand and concise
        language. </li>\n<li>Great cultural fit. Unlike other companies, everyone
        in Intercom talks directly with customers. We don&#39;t hide behind feedback
        forums, and anonymous support addresses. Because of this, it&#39;s incredibly
        important that every member of the success team represents Intercom well.
        That means you must be ambitious, eager to learn and improve yourself, excited

        fully understand what we are trying to build as a company--then make it possible.</p>\n\n<p>We
        are constantly driven to work harder and learn new things not from some top-down
        initiative, but from the feeling that we owe it to our peers to keep up with
        their growth. We have passionate debates about technology with consensus in
        solutions, flexible team structures, an irrelevance of title in problem solving,
        and a desire to Do The Right Thing.</p>\n\n<p>Our culture defines who we are,

        Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, and Debian, but we\u2019re enjoying using some JavaScript
        frameworks and other newer platforms depending on the project. We work to
        stay on the cutting edge of technology and contribute back to open source
        projects, because flexible frameworks build the foundation for our businesses.
        It feels good to give back.</p>\n\n<p>On average, we release two new products
        per year, with two code releases per day, and we\u2019re getting faster all
        the time. We\u2019re dedicated to creating quality software quickly, and we&#39;re
        creating a solid, stable, and flexible service-oriented infrastructure to
        get there.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, we\u2019re Agile, use TDD, and everything else

        problems. You\u2019ll work with other engineers to build the best systems
        for the problem at hand, learning from our lead engineers and architects,
        while mentoring junior developers. Most problems have multiple solutions--you\u2019ll
        be responsible for figuring out which one is best, convince technical teams
        of your solution, and actually make it happen. Product management, analytics,

        for a full-time, highly motivated support developer with a passion for open-source
        technologies, a penchant for customer service, and task-switching skills.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About
        Four Kitchens</strong></p>\n\n<p>(tl;dr: We make BIG websites, we contribute
        tons of code to open-source projects, and we&#39;re doing lots of forward-thinking
        stuff in the mobile space.)</p>\n\n<p><em>We are not your typical web shop.</em></p>\n\n<p>First,
        we only work with open-source software. Why? Because open source is the future,
        and setting knowledge free makes the world a better place. Software should
        be free to use, modify, and distribute so that people all over the world,
        regardless of economic status, can have access to technology and a better
        future.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we&#39;re a lot of fun. And we have style. We not
        only do cool stuff on the web \u2014 we do cool stuff in real life, too. Four
        Kitchens is home to the Web Chefs, some of the most talented and interesting
        people you&#39;ll ever know. Our hobbies include sketch comedy, cycling, car
        racing, rock climbing, yoga, writing, and home brewing. We also actively participate
        in various charities, community meet-ups, and volunteer activities.</p>\n\n<p>Third,
        we deeply value our coworkers. We believe in the power of individuals coming
        together to do something bigger than they could aspire do alone. Four Kitchens
        is not just a company \u2014 it&#39;s a closely knit team. And although we
        work hard, we strive to maintain a good work-life balance. This is why we
        have an unlimited paid leave policy, encourage time off, and look for fun,
        creative projects outside of client work to expand our abilities.</p>\n\n<p>We
        do everything in-house: design, usability, development, information and systems
        architecture, performance tuning, project management, and ongoing support.
        Though most of us are in Austin, Texas, our clients \u2014 major media outlets,
        universities, non-profits, and social reformers \u2014 are global. Our projects
        are mostly large-scale, and they require extensive client collaboration and
        occasional on-site work.</p>\n\n<p>Though we handle (very) big projects, we&#39;re
        small enough that our team members go by names, not numbers. Our Web Chefs
        bring much more than their professional skills to the kitchen, and we encourage

        support tickets based on priority.</li>\n<li>Becoming an expert at our chosen
        open-source platforms. This will require debugging and patching the core components,
        and understanding and debugging the source code of the systems you work with.</li>\n<li>Implementing
        industry-standard devops workflows and tools: dev-stage-production workflow,
        source control tools to manage your codebase, etc.</li>\n<li>Communicating
        openly, transparently, and effectively with clients and team members.</li>\n<li>Working
        individually as well as with other members of the team on problems, as required
        by the project.</li>\n<li>Designing and developing code architecture that
        promotes reuse, readability, and best-practice coding standards.</li>\n<li>Testing
        and debugging at all levels, from unit to acceptance.</li>\n<li>Understanding
